This week I saw myself come to a crux where I made up my mind that work-life balance does not exist at the stage of life in which I am at the moment.

I assume people that preach work-life balance have reached a level of satisfaction with achievement of their set goals. While I myself am an advocate of work-life balance, I just don't see the point now anymore.

I know I heard it somewhere that you should forget about work-life balance while on the come up. I myself like to practicalize before concluding, and I know how far I will go if I keep on taking action:

One task on my task list at a time.

One idea executed to another.

One more conversation.

One more connection.

One more step.

One more action.

No balance, just motion.

And I know I will get what I want. That's how I create my luck.
