Being someone who reflects a lot, this feels like a natural post to make right now. It’s a new year, and we all have different outlooks for the year ahead.

Personally, I’ve been working nonstop since December. On what, you may ask? Urganize. I’ve been working on my startup, and it has been life changing, shocking, stressful at times, and also a lot of fun. Bringing this project to life has been an amazing experience.

If I look back at the past five years and think about what I’ve achieved, I’d say everything has led up to this moment. Knowledge really shapes how you make decisions. This also isn’t my first business. I’ve failed many times and learned a lot along the way. I even spent a whole year just rebuilding myself, learning, and being very intentional about becoming a better person in all areas of my life.

I’ve always known I would do big things as long as I’m alive, or at least try to. Whether they succeed depends on me, external factors, and of course, luck, which is still kind of me, to be honest.

Anyway, I’m here to say that this startup is coming along according to my expectations, and it’s going pretty well. Things feel easier now because of what I’ve learned about business and the constant process of learning how to get a startup off the ground.

It’s fun because this is something I was meant to do. No matter what, the hardest part is execution and dealing with the physical limits of the human body, but even that is something I can and will improve on to reach maximum productivity.

I now journal daily, practice breathing, pray, eat well, exercise, and drink plenty of water. Overall, everything is fine. I’m grateful and looking forward to more, as usual.
