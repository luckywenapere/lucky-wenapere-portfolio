Who I am has always been kind of a mystery to me. I mean, obviously I know who I am, but what's really puzzling is who people think I am.

You know? Sometimes I get these little glimpses, these moments where I catch a hint of how others see me, but the full picture? I've never really been able to wrap my head around it.

But anyway, I kept moving forward. I decided to create myself, to discover who I am through my own lens—through my goals, my aspirations, the things I actually value. And now? This identity I've built, it's mine.

It can only be changed by me. I'm doing my best to make sure no outside influence I'm not aware of gets to shape it. That's the goal, at least.
