Letting go is hard, especially when emotions are attached. That’s the real problem—attachment. When we hold on too tightly, things become blurry. Even if something is hurting us or no longer working, we stay stuck. And when you’re stuck, there’s no space for anything better to enter.

Recently, I had to let go of something big: my company Innr Trth.

Some of you knew me through that brand. It wasn’t just a business; it was part of my identity. I lived and breathed “inner truth.” The logo, the colors, the people I worked with—everything came from that identity. I carried it like a birthmark, like it was my life’s mission.

But then logic finally stepped in. I had to face an objective choice—one that felt like it could make or break my future. It sounds dramatic, but it was real for me. So I ended it. No backup plan. No roadmap. I simply took the leap, quit, and released the statement without explaining why. The reason was personal.

But there is always light at the end of the tunnel.

Out of all that uncertainty, a new idea appeared—one that didn’t even start as an app. That story is for another day. For now, just know this:

Urganize is born.

This will be my new obsession until I reach everything I’ve planned for it. My goal is simple: total domination of the music management market.

The last time I made a promise like this, I kept it.
Watch and see.
