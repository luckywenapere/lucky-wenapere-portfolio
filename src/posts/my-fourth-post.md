Some people say we've been using AI long before it became popular. Maybe, maybe not. I don't really know the details. This is not a technical blog. It's just my blog.

So where did it really start for me? First, let me explain what I mean by "got into AI." I mean using it for my work. Things like software development, filmmaking, and design.

It started when I was in post graduate school. I had my final project to do. But I kept putting it off for months. Why? Because Google and other websites were not helpful. They were annoying

Then one day, my dad called me. He asked how my project was going. I had nothing to say. I just stuttered. So he took my laptop and searched "chatgpt" on Google. The rest is history, it changed everything.

Here's the funny part. I already knew about ChatGPT. But I didn't want to use it because everyone was talking about it. When something is popular, I usually stay away from it. That's just how I am. But AI was different. It wasn't going anywhere. So I finally gave it a try.
